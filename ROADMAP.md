# ExlSer Roadmap

This document is the working roadmap for the project. It defines what is already complete, what must be done next, and which completion checkpoint each group of work unlocks.

Milestones are written as arrival points: the required work comes first, then the release/publication checkpoint appears after the checklist that makes it possible.

- [ ] Do not start a step until the previous step in the same section is implemented and tested

## Architecture Rules

The app follows a layered architecture:

```text
core
domain
data
application
presentation
```

Dependency direction:

```text
presentation -> application/domain
application  -> domain
data         -> domain
core         -> shared infrastructure
```

State management:

```text
Riverpod = dependency wiring, routing, settings, lightweight ViewModels,
           temporary UI state, and the import wizard.

BLoC     = dataset workspace: opened dataset, active sheet, filters,
           sorting, rows, refresh events, view mode, and analytics.
```

Product rule:

```text
A persistent dataset is created only after the final wizard confirmation.
Before confirmation, the user must be able to review the file, sheets,
column names, and column types.
```

## Current Status

### Automatic Chart Suggestion Rules

The dataset workspace should behave like a guided lightweight BI surface.
After import and schema confirmation, `DatasetView` reads the detected column
types and proposes a useful initial visualization instead of starting from an
empty analytics panel.

Supported column types:

- `text`
- `integer`
- `real`
- `boolean`
- `date`

Initial chart priority:

1. If at least one `date` column and one numeric column exist, suggest a
   time-based line or area chart.
2. Otherwise, if at least one `text` column and one numeric column exist,
   suggest a category chart. Use a pie/donut chart for small category sets and
   a bar/column chart for larger category sets.
3. Otherwise, if at least two numeric columns exist, suggest a scatter plot.
4. Otherwise, if at least one boolean column exists, suggest a true/false
   distribution chart.
5. Otherwise, show the table and a clear "no automatic chart available"
   analytics empty state.

### Chart Rules

Category distribution:

- Required columns: one `text` column and one numeric column.
- Default chart: pie/donut for up to roughly 8-10 categories.
- Fallback chart: bar/column when category count is higher.
- Label: selected text column.
- Value: selected numeric column aggregated by category.
- Controls: label column, value column, aggregation (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`,
  `MIN`, `MAX`), sort direction, and top-N limit.

Time series:

- Required columns: one `date` column and one numeric column.
- Default chart: line or area chart.
- X axis: selected date column.
- Y axis: selected numeric column.
- Optional grouping: selected text column for series/category split.
- Controls: date column, numeric column, optional category column,
  aggregation, and chart type (`line` or `area`).

Scatter plot:

- Required columns: at least two numeric columns.
- X axis: selected numeric column.
- Y axis: selected numeric column.
- Optional grouping/label: selected text column.
- Controls: x numeric column, y numeric column, optional group column.

Boolean distribution:

- Required columns: one boolean column.
- Default chart: pie/donut or bar chart with true/false counts.
- Optional numeric aggregation: sum or average of a numeric column grouped by
  boolean value.

Regression and forecast:

- Candidate inputs: two numeric columns, or one `date` column plus one numeric
  target column.
- First implementation should stay simple: linear regression, moving average,
  and lightweight trend lines.
- Forecast controls: x/date column, target numeric column, forecast horizon,
  and method (`trend`, `moving_average`, `linear_regression`).
- This is an advanced analytics enhancement and can be delivered after the
  first basic charting release if needed.

### DatasetView Analytics Layout

The analytics section should be integrated into `DatasetView` without replacing
the read-only table.

Planned structure:

```text
DatasetView
├── Dataset header
├── Sheet selector
├── Suggested chart panel
│   ├── Chart type selector
│   ├── X/category dropdown
│   ├── Y/value dropdown
│   ├── Aggregation dropdown
│   ├── Optional group/top-N/sort controls
│   └── Chart
├── Data table
└── Filters / stats
```

For the first analytics release, the table should remain the primary reliable
surface and the suggested chart panel can appear above or below it. A more BI-
oriented workspace can move toward a chart panel plus table workspace after the
read-only and filtering flows are stable.

### Milestone Reached: v0.4.0 - Basic Analytics

Publish criteria:

- [ ] The user can see basic aggregations and suggested charts for the opened
      dataset.
- [ ] The first chart is selected automatically from column types.
- [ ] The user can change chart columns and aggregation from dropdown controls.
- [ ] Analytics respects the selected sheet and active filters.

## Path to Cross-Sheet and Multi-Dataset Analysis

Goal: analyze relationships across sheets and datasets.

- [ ] Define cross-sheet operation models.
- [ ] Load metadata for multiple sheets.
- [ ] Detect compatible columns.
- [ ] Implement simple merge/union.
- [ ] Evaluate join support.

- [ ] Implement UI for selecting sheets/datasets.
- [ ] Add tests for cross-sheet operations.

### Milestone Reached: v0.5.0 - Cross-Sheet and Multi-Dataset Analysis

Publish criteria:

- [ ] The user can compare or combine at least two sheets/datasets.

## Path to UX, Settings, and Polish

Goal: improve the user experience across platforms.

- [ ] Implement real settings.
- [ ] Persist language selection.
- [ ] Persist theme selection.
- [ ] Add useful first-run onboarding.
- [ ] Improve empty states.
- [ ] Improve loading states.
- [ ] Improve error states with actions.

- [ ] Define database backup/restore strategy.
- [ ] Handle large files and memory limits.
- [ ] Add progressive import or chunking where needed.
- [ ] Add performance tests on realistic datasets.
- [ ] Update CI for test/build/release workflows.
- [ ] Produce release builds for target platforms.
- [ ] Add privacy notes for local data.
- [ ] Add user documentation.
- [ ] Add complete changelog and release notes.

### Milestone Reached: v1.0.0 - Stable Public Release

Publish criteria:

- [ ] The app is stable for real-world use.
- [ ] Releases are reproducible.
- [ ] User and developer documentation are complete enough for public users.

## Legacy Migration

Legacy code should be removed only after the equivalent new flow is complete:

- [ ] `features/excel/*`
- [ ] old model/control/provider/view folders if still present.
- [ ] legacy export use cases once replaced by the new domain/application export flow.
- [ ] placeholder widgets no longer used by real screens.

Removal rule:

```text
Do not remove legacy code if it breaks a flow that has not been replaced yet.
Every removal should have a test or a manual verification of the equivalent flow.
```

## Future Ideas

These are not part of the first publishable release:

- [ ] BI dashboard.
- [ ] Saved import templates.
- [ ] Advanced data validation.
- [ ] Invalid value correction during import.
- [ ] Data quality profiling.
- [ ] Automatic column type suggestions.
- [ ] Statistical models or regression.
- [ ] Optional AI/ML features.

## Next Operational Step

Immediate next step:

- [ ] Path to the First Publishable Preview - Step 4: Add Final Confirmation and Dataset Creation.

Practical order:

1. Show final summary from `confirmedImport`.
2. Call `SaveUploadedFileUseCase` with the selected save mode.
3. Call `CreateDatasetService.createDataset` only on Finish.
4. Use the real `CreatedDatasetResult.datasetId`.
5. Clear the Home selected file after success.
6. Navigate to `DatasetView` with the real dataset id.
