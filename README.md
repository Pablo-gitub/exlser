## Building Instructions
In .github/workflows you can find the Flutter build action files on github for three different specific case 
### console.yml
this file allow you to release desktop version Windows, MacOS and Linux
### dart.yml
this file allow you to release iOS version
### iosAndroid.yml
this file allow you to release mobile version iOS and Android

```bash
name: "Desktop Build & Release"

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
```

this part specify when you want the release to get update

```bash
jobs:
  build-linux:
    name: Build Linux
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Clone repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: stable
      - name: Install Linux Dependencies
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update -y
          sudo apt-get install -y ninja-build libgtk-3-dev
      - name: Install project dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
      - name: Build Linux
        run: flutter build linux --release
      - name: Archive Linux Build
        run: zip -r linux-build.zip build/linux/x64/release/bundle/
      - name: Upload Linux Build Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: linux-build
          path: linux-build.zip
```

## Important Points About This Portion of the GitHub Actions Configuration for Linux Build
### Cloning the Repository
*Importance*: Cloning the repository is the first step to ensure that the latest version of the code is available for the build. Without this step, the workflow would not have access to the project files.
### Setting Up Flutter
*Details*: This step uses the 'subosito/flutter-action' to set up Flutter, specifying the stable channel. This ensures that the versions of Flutter being used are reliable and well-tested.
### Installing Linux Dependencies
*Details*: Installing dependencies such as 'ninja-build' and 'libgtk-3-dev' is crucial for correctly compiling the application on Linux. Specifying necessary dependencies helps prevent compilation errors during the build phase.
### Installing Project Dependencies
*Importance*: Running 'flutter pub get' ensures that all the dependencies specified in the 'pubspec.yaml' file are installed, allowing the application to compile correctly.
### Building the Application
*Details*: The command 'flutter build linux --release compiles the app in release mode, optimizing performance and reducing the size of the resulting package. This step is critical for distributing the app to end users.
### Archiving the Build
*Reason for Zipping*: Creating a zip archive of the build helps prevent duplicate files and makes distribution easier. A compact zip file simplifies downloading and managing artifacts.
### Uploading the Build Artifact
*Importance*: Using 'actions/upload-artifact' allows you to save the build artifact (the zip file) so that it can be easily downloaded later. This is useful for releasing and debugging built versions.

```bash
build-windows:
    name: Build Windows
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Clone repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: stable
      - name: Install project dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
      - name: Build Windows
        run: flutter build windows --release
      - name: Archive Windows Build
        run: Compress-Archive -Path build/windows/x64/runner/Release -DestinationPath windows-build.zip
      - name: Upload Windows Build Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: windows-build
          path: windows-build.zip

  build-macos:
    name: Build macOS
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - name: Clone repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: stable
      - name: Install project dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
      - name: Build macOS
        run: flutter build macos --release
      - name: Archive macOS Build
        run: zip -r macos-build.zip build/macos/Build/Products/Release/
      - name: Upload macOS Build Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: macos-build
          path: macos-build.zip
```

Windows and macOS builds share similarities with the Linux build process but have key distinctions due to their operating system environments and specific requirements. Here’s a comparison highlighting the differences:

> **Note:** Building for macOS requires a macOS environment, as the Flutter build process relies on tools such as Xcode that are only available on Mac computers. Ensure you are running the build on a compatible Mac machine to avoid errors during the build process.

## Distinctions
## Environment
*Windows*: Runs on 'windows-latest', leveraging Windows-specific tools and commands for the build process.
*macOS*: Runs on 'macos-latest', tailored for Apple's ecosystem, which may include different handling of file permissions and app signing.
## Build Command
*Windows*: Uses 'flutter build windows --release' to create a release build optimized for Windows.
*macOS*: Uses 'flutter build macos --release', which may involve additional steps for signing and packaging the app for distribution on macOS.
## Archiving the Build
*Windows*: Uses the 'Compress-Archive' command to zip the build output directory.
*macOS*: Uses the 'zip -r' command to create a zip archive of the build products, with different paths and structures.
## Output Path
The output paths differ for Windows and macOS, reflecting the specific file structures and naming conventions of each operating system.

```bash
  release:
    name: Release Desktop Artifacts
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build-linux, build-windows, build-macos]
    steps:
      - name: Download Linux artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: linux-build
          path: ./builds/
      - name: Download Windows artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: windows-build
          path: ./builds/
      - name: Download macOS artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: macos-build
          path: ./builds/
      - name: Create Release
        uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
        with:
          artifacts: |
            ./builds/linux-build.zip
            ./builds/windows-build.zip
            ./builds/macos-build.zip
          tag: desktop-v1.0.${{ github.run_number }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TRY_EXCELETOR_TOKEN }}
```

### Steps Breakdown

1. **Job Name and Environment**:
   - The job is named **Release Desktop Artifacts** and runs on the `ubuntu-latest` environment, ensuring a consistent platform for the release process.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - The job specifies `needs: [build-linux, build-windows, build-macos]`, indicating that it must wait for the completion of the build jobs for Linux, Windows, and macOS before executing.

3. **Downloading Artifacts**:
   - Each of the three steps uses `actions/download-artifact@v4` to download the built artifacts from the previous jobs.
   - The artifacts are downloaded into a local `./builds/` directory, facilitating organization and access during the release process.

4. **Creating the Release**:
   - The final step uses `ncipollo/release-action@v1` to create a release on GitHub.
   - The artifacts (Linux, Windows, and macOS builds) are specified in the `artifacts` section, ensuring they are included in the release.
   - A version tag is generated using the pattern `desktop-v1.0.${{ github.run_number }}`, where `github.run_number` provides a unique number for each run, helping to track releases effectively.
   - The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set to `${{ secrets.TRY_EXCELETOR_TOKEN }}`, which is required for authentication to create the release in the repository.

```bash
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build & Release
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: 'zulu'
          java-version: '17'
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: 'stable'
          architecture: x64

      - run: flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
      - run: |
          flutter build ios --no-codesign
          cd build/ios/iphoneos
          mkdir Payload
          cd Payload
          ln -s ../Runner.app
          cd ..
          zip -r app.ipa Payload
      - name: Push to Releases
        uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
        with:
          artifacts: "build/app/outputs/apk/release/*,build/ios/iphoneos/app.ipa"
          tag: v1.0.${{ github.run_number }}
          token: ${{ secrets.TRY_EXCELETOR_TOKEN }}
```
### Build and Release Job Breakdown

1. **Job Name and Environment**:
   - The job is named **Build & Release** and runs on the `macos-latest` environment, ensuring compatibility with macOS-specific build processes.

2. **Checkout Repository**:
   - The first step uses `actions/checkout@v4` to clone the repository, providing access to the project files needed for the build.

3. **Set Up Java**:
   - The job uses `actions/setup-java@v4` to set up Java, specifying the **Zulu** distribution and version **17**. This step is essential for projects that require Java for building dependencies or plugins.

4. **Set Up Flutter**:
   - The `subosito/flutter-action@v2` is used to set up Flutter, specifying the **stable** channel and architecture **x64**. This ensures the build process uses a reliable version of Flutter.

5. **Build APK for Android**:
   - The command `flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi` builds the Android APK in release mode, generating separate APKs for each ABI (Application Binary Interface) to optimize app performance.

6. **Build IPA for iOS**:
   - The command `flutter build ios --no-codesign` builds the iOS application without code signing, which is useful for creating an IPA for distribution.
   - The subsequent commands create a directory structure and symlink to package the app into a ZIP file, resulting in `app.ipa`.

7. **Push to Releases**:
   - The final step uses `ncipollo/release-action@v1` to push the built artifacts to the GitHub Releases section.
   - The artifacts specified include the APK files from the Android build and the IPA file for iOS, ensuring both are available for download.
   - A version tag is created using the pattern `v1.0.${{ github.run_number }}`, where `github.run_number` provides a unique identifier for each run.
   - The `token` is set to `${{ secrets.TRY_EXCELETOR_TOKEN }}`, which is necessary for authentication to create the release.
